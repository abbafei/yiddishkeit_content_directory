- entity types:
	- endpoint (e.g. android app, pdf file, web site link, rss feed)
	- resource (e.g. app, book, video series/podcast)
	- site/organization/group

- preprocessor/uniformeralach processor types:
	- input types:
		- endpoint: a string, or a map with ref key and optional label
		- endpoints:
			- can be string, output one web endpoint
			- can be map, in which case each value in it...
				- can be a string, which is output as one endpoint with key type, and a ref with no label
				- can be an array, in which each entry is an endpoint
		- type (content only) - media type
			- can be a string
			- can be a list of strings (type, subtype, sub-subtype, vechulu, kind of like mime type)
		- title
			- can be a string, if so output just main title
			- can be a map with main (title) and subtitle
		- fee - can be boolean or map
			- if map, key called "has_fee" with bool value, and optional description with more detail about fee
	- output types:
		- languages (content only?) - optional list of language code strings
		- site_id - optional id of a site it is created by/part of
		- part_of - optional id of another item of which item is a part
		- title - human-readable name
		- subtitle - optional subtitle, from site
		- description (content only?) - describes the content
		- main_category: main category of the content
		- tags (content only) - categories of the content - list of strings
		- target_audience (content only) - optional, list of audience types (strings) that content seems tailored to
		- endpoint: a map, with keys ref (the input itself, if it was a string) and label
		- endpoints: a map
			- keys representing the endpoint type
			- values should be lists, with each item an endpoint
				- if we want to get only one endpoint and no more, prefer ones without a label, and prefer ones earlier in list to later ones
		- TODO: other description refactoring and short_description
		- content_type - list of strings - type of the item entry
			- types #: multiple types allowed, no hierarchy, tag-like
				#- brand - something with a logo, more or less :-)
				#	- TODO: use brand key instead?
				#- org - an organization or group who produces content, has one or more brands (it can also serve as a brand)
				- channel - a live (continuous? stream-like thing) with audio or video etc. (not a channel with multiple elements like podcast)
				- series - a group of items with an order (set-like)
				- group - like series, but unordered, and can have subzachin(?)
				- item - an individual video/audio/text/etc.
		- content_type: video, audio, text
			- TODO: way to indicate if something is content without specifying content type? (perhaps content_type: true?, or see if any items have a content_type, or have it as related_ids subitem or content)
		- container_type: how it's accessed
			- app
		- fee - array with map. earlier items in array take precedence, if we are before "until" date
			- has_fee - boolean
			- description - optional string
			- until - iso 8601 date/time; is time fee field applies until

TODO
	- bichlall
		- add items in this list to gitlab issue tracker :-)
	- schemas etc.
		- make a schema for content and site objectsalach (for unprocessed/input objects too)?
		- types.yml schema?
	- item info
		- languages
			- language codes - which system/standard should these follow?
			- languages - if same content in multiple languages, do they have more than one content entry? what if same site but different content for each language?
			- filter languages?
		- fees
			- add "from" field to fees? (like "until")
		- endpoints
			- coalesce similar endpoint types (youtube for example)? if so, what if there are duplicates or endpoints that contain others (e.g. youtube channel that has playlist from endpoint)
			- main link:
				- make a piece of data that indicates to use a specific endpoint url for an item if there is no (preferred) web endpoint?
				- also make one that gets used by default if none is indicated specifically
				- use parent web link sometimes? or maybe if indicated specifically?
			- item and/or endpoint rss feeds - specify manually? or add to web-type endpoints? or scrape from web sites automatically? or both?
			- whatsapp group - include link to whatsapp group? if so, under content item or org item etc.?
		- content types
			- for series content type, make a data field for how often items in series are released, if applicable? (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
		- distinguish between descriptions and subtitles by the site itself, and descriptions by other peoplesalach
			- add remaining keys (description etc. at present) to item info pages
		- verification that references to types in type definitions exist (may be able to do this by templating the schema, and inserting the type values)
		- automatically generate item_types key? (with values/tags like content, brand, app, container/access_method
		- hierarchies
			- make able to generate hierarchy from related_ids
				- also can copy relevant data from those items e.g. target audience, categories, etc.
		- multi-part items
			- endpoint type? or related_ids type?
		- make better alternative to "more" categories and media_types?
	- compilation
	- rendering etc.
		- show individual page title in <title> html element also (aside from site title), including for paginated (generated) pages
		- fix everything shifting between pages in navbar and rest of pages
		- item links and more macros/functions in templating vechulu
			- eleventyConfig.addFilter("item_id_to_info_link", function(value) { return `items/${this.slug(value)}`; });
