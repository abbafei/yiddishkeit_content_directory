- entity types:
	- endpoint (e.g. android app, pdf file, web site link, rss feed)
	- resource (e.g. app, book, video series/podcast)
	- site/organization/group

- preprocessor/uniformeralach processor types:
	- input types:
		- endpoint: a string, or a map with ref key and optional label
		- endpoints:
			- can be string, output one web endpoint
			- can be map, in which case each value in it...
				- can be a string, which is output as one endpoint with key type, and a ref with no label
				- can be an array, in which each entry is an endpoint
		- type (content only) - media type
			- can be a string
			- can be a list of strings (type, subtype, sub-subtype, vechulu, kind of like mime type)
		- title
			- can be a string, if so output just main title
			- can be a map with main (title) and subtitle
		- fee - can be boolean or map
			- if map, key called "value" with bool value, and optional description with more detail about fee value
	- output types:
		- languages (content only?) - optional list of language code strings
		- site_id - id of a site
		- name - human-readable name
		- description (content only?) - describes the content
		- categories (content only) - list of strings
		- target_audience (content only) - optional, list of audience types (strings) that content seems tailored to
		- endpoint: a map, with keys ref (the input itself, if it was a string) and label
		- endpoints: a map
			- keys representing the endpoint type
			- values should be lists, with each item an endpoint
				- if we want to get only one endpoint and no more, prefer ones without a label, and prefer ones earlier in list to later ones
		- type - list of strings (type hierarchy kind of like mime type)
		- title - a map
			- main - title
			- subtitle - optional subtitle
		- fee - map
			- value - boolean
			- description - optional string

TODO
	- make a schema for content and site objectsalach (for both unprocessed objects and preprocessed ones)?
		- if so, lint (i.e. check) against those schemas when running preprocessor?
	- make contents able to have content_id, the way sites can have site_id? (i.e. hierarchy for contents)
	- language codes - which system/standard do these follow?
	- languages - if same content in multiple languages, do they have more than one content entry? what if same site but different content for each language?
