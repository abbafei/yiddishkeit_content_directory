- entity types:
	- endpoint (e.g. android app, pdf file, web site link, rss feed)
	- resource (e.g. app, book, video series/podcast)
	- site/organization/group

- preprocessor/uniformeralach processor types:
	- input types:
		- endpoint: a string, or a map with ref key and optional label
		- endpoints:
			- can be string, output one web endpoint
			- can be map, in which case each value in it...
				- can be a string, which is output as one endpoint with key type, and a ref with no label
				- can be an array, in which each entry is an endpoint
		- type (content only) - media type
			- can be a string
			- can be a list of strings (type, subtype, sub-subtype, vechulu, kind of like mime type)
		- title
			- can be a string, if so output just main title
			- can be a map with main (title) and subtitle
		- fee - can be boolean or map
			- if map, key called "has_fee" with bool value, and optional description with more detail about fee
	- output types:
		- languages (content only?) - optional list of language code strings
		- site_id - optional id of a site it is created by/part of
		- part_of - optional id of another item of which item is a part
		- name - human-readable name
		- description (content only?) - describes the content
		- category: a map
			- main: main category of the content
			- tags (content only) - categories of the content - list of strings
		- target_audience (content only) - optional, list of audience types (strings) that content seems tailored to
		- endpoint: a map, with keys ref (the input itself, if it was a string) and label
		- endpoints: a map
			- keys representing the endpoint type
			- values should be lists, with each item an endpoint
				- if we want to get only one endpoint and no more, prefer ones without a label, and prefer ones earlier in list to later ones
		- item_type - list of strings - type of the item entry
			- types: multiple types allowed, no hierarchy, tag-like
				- brand - something with a logo, more or less :-)
				- org - an organization or group who produces content, has one or more brands (it can also serve as a brand)
				- channel - a live (continuous? stream-like thing) with audio or video etc. (not a channel with multiple elements like podcast)
				- series - a group of items with an order (set-like)
				- group - like series, but unordered, and can have subzachin(?)
				- item - an individual video/audio/text/etc.
		- content_type: video, audio, text
		- accessed_with: how it's accessed
			- app
		- title - a map
			- main - title
			- subtitle - optional subtitle
		- fee - array with map. earlier items in array take precedence, if we are before "until" date
			- has_fee - boolean
			- description - optional string
			- until - iso 8601 date/time; is time fee field applies until

TODO
	- schemas etc.
		- make a schema for content and site objectsalach (for both unprocessed objects and preprocessed ones)?
			- if so, lint (i.e. check) against those schemas when running preprocessor?
		- encode hierarchy possibilities in schema?
	- hierarchies
		- differentiate between sites/orgs and brands for content?
		- make able to have hierarchy with site_ids and part_ofs
		- multiple site_ids or part_ofs?
	- languages
		- language codes - which system/standard do these follow?
		- languages - if same content in multiple languages, do they have more than one content entry? what if same site but different content for each language?
		- filter languages?
	- fees
		- add "from" field to fees? (like "until")
	- endpoints
		 - coalesce similar endpoint types (youtube for example)? if so, what if there are duplicates or endpoints that contain others (e.g. youtube channel that has playlist from endpoint)
